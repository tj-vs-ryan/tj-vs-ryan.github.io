<h1>Model UN</h1>
  <body>
    <p>Ms. Moran and Mr. Larkin went with us to the National Model UN in University College Cork.I would love to say that I learned a lot about politics at this competition. However, I did not partake in the conventional Model UN. I was given the task of representing Newbridge College in the Historical Crisis section of Model UN.</p>
    <p>This section of Model Un is focussed on an event that happened in history. This particular historical crisis was the War of Independence in America. All of the delegates in this section were supposed to work together to defeat the British. However, it turned into a competition in which people plotted to kill one another for reasons I cannot understand. All of the other three delegates were experienced in the historical crisis section, and I had no clue that this was the spirit of this section: I was simply trying to kill the British!!</p>
    <p>I didn't receive an award, largely due to my inexperience in this nuance section of the competition. However, Model UN was a very fun experience. My section wasn't taken nearly as seriously as the others' and I had a lot of fun trying to win a war.</p>
